Basically a class which parses the NIST Atomic Spectra Database and saves the data to a dictionary on HDD. 
Also includes a traits representation to set the parameters within a gui and plot or print them.  
As an object, you can pass an matplotlib.axis, and the emissions lines will be plotted with an optional normalization factor.
